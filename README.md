# Advent of Code 2021

## Day 1 - ⭐⭐
This was a fun little activity to practice some Ruby one-liners. I think I'd learnt from last year the value of Ruby's `each_cons` method, so piecing this together was relatively straightforward.

## Day 2 - ⭐⭐
Sticking with short Ruby blocks for as long as I can. Managed to get Part 1 done pretty simply by just dividing up the array and summing parts together. Part 2 I went with the simplest solution conceptually, which was just to iterate through all the commands, updating the position, depth, and aim variables on each loop based on the current command. Nothing fancy there.

## Day 3 - ⭐⭐
Fun with recursion and Ruby block arguments!

I do feel like there should have been a better way to do 'count all the 1s in a column' than just iterating through the list. I think it's probably a sign that Ruby wasn't built for this kind of data processing.
