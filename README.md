# Advent of Code 2021

## Day 1 - ⭐⭐
This was a fun little activity to practice some Ruby one-liners. I think I'd learnt from last year the value of Ruby's `each_cons` method, so piecing this together was relatively straightforward.

## Day 2 - ⭐⭐
Sticking with short Ruby blocks for as long as I can. Managed to get Part 1 done pretty simply by just dividing up the array and summing parts together. Part 2 I went with the simplest solution conceptually, which was just to iterate through all the commands, updating the position, depth, and aim variables on each loop based on the current command. Nothing fancy there.
